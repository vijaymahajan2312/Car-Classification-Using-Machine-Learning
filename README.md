# Car-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
In this project, I have developed a model which classifies vehicles as Large, Compact, Midsize, Sporty and Van. With help of Random Forest. Random Forests: is one of the most generalizable algorithms for classification tasks. It utilizes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines many classifiers to provide solutions to complex problems. Random Forests algorithms perform well in many applications.
